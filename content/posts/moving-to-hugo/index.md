## Why
Why did I move my site to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)? I wonder that myself, but at the end of the day there is a simple reason.... ease.. Well in theory, we will see how it goes.

## Jekyll
I looked a Jekyll and almost went with it. But was not sure, you never know I may well move this to Jekyll at a later point.

## Other Sites

I'm going to try to cross post some of my stuff to [Hashnode](https://hasnode.com), or I may well just post on [Hashnode](https://tanzy.hashnode.dev). I will be using the domain [kenlea.blog](https://www.kenlea.blog).
