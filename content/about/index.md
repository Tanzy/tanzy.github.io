## Who am I

Hello, I’m Ken and I’m the _Senior Software Developer_ who is very fortunate to be doing a job that I love.

## Background

I’ve been in software development for over 20 years, taking on various roles. My career started programming using Visual Basic 3, but these days it’s been mainly C#.

Working in various industries, I spent a couple of years doing a lot of network engineering, including an upgrade from NT4 to Windows 2000. This is where my interest in Software Architecture and Networking came from. These days I mainly work on backend systems implementing Web APIs using C# within Azure. I have an interest in DevOps and automation around building and testing.

## Free time

Outside of work, I enjoy medieval gunnery as part of a re-enactment group, also enjoy a good afternoon tea and making beeswax candles.
